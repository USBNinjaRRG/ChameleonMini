ChameleonMini & ChameleonTiny by ProxGrind
==============
This is the NOT official repository of ChameleonMini by Kasper & Oswald but the source code can be used interchangable, 

ChameleonMini and ChameleonTiny by ProxGrind both are a freely programmable, portable tool for NFC security analysis that can emulate and clone contactless cards, read RFID tags and sniff/log RF data. 

Our Project is based on the open-source project by ChameleonMini RevG by Kasper & Oswald [Webshop](https://shop.kasper.it/). 

Our ChameleonMini / ChameleonTiny by ProxGrind is available on Indiegogo now.
